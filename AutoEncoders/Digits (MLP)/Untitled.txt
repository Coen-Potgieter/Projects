# What i did

- Created a requirements.txt file
    ```
    pipreqs .
    ```
    - Note were are using `tensorflow-macos==2.10.0`
    
- installed `pyenv` using homebrew
    ```bash
    brew install pyenv
    ```
- Installed vesrion 3.10.13
    ```bash
    pyenv install 3.10.13
    ```
    
- Create virtual envireonment with specific python version:
    ```bash
    python3.10 -m venv env
    ```
- Activate it
    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```
- Install from reqiurements.txt
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    
- THEY CHANGED EVERYTHING HERE IS HOW TO DO MODELS NOW - CHANGE YOUR CODE:
    - Simply changed path extension from `auto.keras` to `auto`
    - Then retrain model and save with `auto_encoder.save(auto_path, save_format="keras")`
    - Then Load mode with `auto_encoder.save(auto_path, save_format="keras")`

    
    
- Shows how playing with latent space changes the output
- Leverages tensor flow
