<h1>Traditional Auto-Encoders</h1>
<hr/>
<ul>
	<li>
	This is my exploration of auto-encoders
	</li>
	<li>
	'Faces' is the main course of the two
	</li>
	<li>
	Both these programs take an input image and compress it (quite substantially) using an encoder, then enlarges it again using a decoder. 
	</li>
	<li>
	It is trained with the original images ie. no noise, or missing pixels and things
	</li>
	<li>
	I did this because:
		<ol>
			<li>
			I wanted to learn the basics of auto-encoders
			</li>
			<li>
			I always had the plan to play around with the latent space and generate images (however blurry and disfigured)
			</li>
			<li>
			I assumed training would be less intensive
			</li>
		</ol>
		
	</li>
</ul>
