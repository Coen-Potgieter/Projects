<h1>ML Digit Recognition</h1>
<hr/>
<ul>
  <li>
    This is my "Hello World" for MLPs
  </li>
  <li>
    I made my own MLP using only numpy to grasp the core concepts of how MLPs work
  </li>
  <li>
    In 'main.py' there are the 3 main functions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        'learn()' - performs SGD
      </li>
      <li>
        'test()' - Tests network against the true labels
      </li>
      <li>
        'draw()' - Allows network to predict on your drawn digits, as you draw them.
            (This one took some doing to get right, and still its not great)
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<em>Note: You do have to click 'start' at that little popup everytime the thing runs, this is a UI for the MLP settings but still comes up even if you're not going to train the model</em>
