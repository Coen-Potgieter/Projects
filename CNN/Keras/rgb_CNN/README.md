<h1>RGB Images</h1>
<hr/>
<ul>
  <li>
    This is my first time working with RGB images
  </li>
  <li>
    Seems like these are much more difficult to get high accuracies
  </li>
  <li>
    Tried/trying to see if keep RGB channels sperate makes a big difference, This taught me how to use keras in a non Sequential way
  </li>
  <li>
    Will do more research on how to build <u>good</u> networks
  </li>
</ul>
