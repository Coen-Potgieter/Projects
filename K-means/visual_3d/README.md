<h1>Visualizing K-means clustering 3D</h1>
<hr/>
<ul>
  <li>
    This is the same as the 2d version just in 3D
  </li>
  <li>
    Massively improved upon the k-means functions, could probably further vectorize find_mean()
  </li>
  <li>
    Can play around with:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The number of clusters
      </li>
      <li>
        Number of points
      </li>
      <li>
        Delay for each step (ms)
      </li>
    </ul>
