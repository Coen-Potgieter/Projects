<h1>Visualizing K-means clustering</h1>
<hr/>
<ul>
  <li>
    Decided to try tackle k-means clustering
  </li>
  <li>
    This visualizes each optimization step in 2 dimensions
  </li>
  <li>
    Can play around with:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The number of clusters
      </li>
      <li>
        Number of points
      </li>
      <li>
        Delay for each step (ms)
      </li>
    </ul>
<hr/>

<h4>Why learn k-means</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Apply to segmenting images is really all I wanted to do
  </li>
</ul>

<em>This is terrible code, just logic-ed it out after seeing how it works, will  try to optimize things at some point</em>
